<h3>Abstract </h3>
<p>India is a global hotspot with several unicorn startups competing against the rest of the globe on multiple platforms and sectors. In addition to privately owned, LLP and foreign companies, India registers more than 10,000 private limited companies each month with the Department of Corporate Affairs. Analyzing data on registration places and business types can reveal the direction the industry is moving. This gives us a glimpse of the future.</p>

<h3>Aims and Objective of the study:</h3>
<p>
(i) To know if the startups in India are dependent on location of registration 
(ii) To know if the startups in India are dependent on the type of business.
(iii) Linear relationship between number of startups and location of registration.
(iv)  Linear relationship between number of startups and type of business.
</p>

<h3>Research Hypotheses:</h3>
<h5>HYPOTHESIS 1</h5>
<ul>
  <li>H0: There is no relation between the number of startups and where they are registered in India.</li>
  <li>H1: The number of startups and the place where they are registered in India have a strong correlation.</li>
</ul>

<h5>HYPOTHESIS 2</h5>
<ul>
<l1>H0: In India, there is no discernible link between the number of startups and the type of firm.</l1>
<l1>H1: In India, the number of startups and the type of business have a substantial link.</l1>
</ul>

<h3>Materials and methods </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hypothesis testing</li>
  <li>Chi square test</li>
  <li>	Linear regression</li>
  <li>Python and Jupyter notebook</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusions:</h3>

<p>Through our model, we were able to determine by hypothesis testing using Chi square method that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Number of startups and their location are dependent on each other.</li>
  <li>Number of startups and their type are dependent on each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Linear Regression, we have built a model through which we will be able to predict the no of startup based on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Location of the startup</li>
  <li>Type of business of the startup</li>
</ul>


<p>Thus, we came to a conclusion that the number of startups is dependent on both the location and the type of business.</p>


<h3>Further Work:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We can use the above hypothesis testing model to determine the relationship between the number of startups and other factors such as capital, class, company etc.</li>
  <li>We can also use the linear regression model to predict the number of startups based on other factors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
<p>
  With immense satisfaction, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation to Ziya Uddain Sir for the sincere support he has given us. We are grateful for being given the opportunity to complete this project and for providing us with the chance to expand our and everyone else's understanding of hypothesis testing and regression analysis.
I'd also like to thank my classmates for being so cooperative and helpful during the entire endeavor.
